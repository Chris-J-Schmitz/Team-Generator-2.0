# Predecessor Team Generator 2.0 
This is a remake of the Predecessor Team Generator I build a few months ago. [Old Site](https://www.predecessorteamgenerator.com/)
The site has two filter options: "Correct Roles" and "Random Roles". 
These filters determine the type of team composition generated. Either a team with characters in their correct roles based on the 
roles they are given in the game. Or a team with characters in random roles for a more fun and interesting team composition. 

# Updates
There are a few updates to the project.
The images now rapidly change when the 'Generate' button is clicked to make the selection of the character more visually appealing. 

# Reason for Rebuild
The project was re built to learn and become more familiar with React and Tailwind CSS.
